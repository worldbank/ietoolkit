# Vignettes

In this folder you can put article styled documentation.
What do we mean by that?
These article styled vignettes is supposed to be a complement to
the command documentation written in the mdhlp-files
which are later rendered into sthlp-files.

Helpfiles should be technical descriptions on how to
run a command, what the options are,
how they are specified, and what the expected outcome is.

Article styled documentation compliments that by being a
long-form guide that can be more narrative than technical.
Article styled documentation is also a better place for subjective best-practices
than helpfiles as helpfiles should be objective.

For example, a vignette can be about the initial motivation behind a command,
it can be about how multiple commands in the package can work together,
or anything else the authors of a package wants to communicate to the users.
