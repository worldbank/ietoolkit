### Title
'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands for reproducible research

### Description

ietoolkit provides a set of commands that
automates common tasks in reproducible research.
This package is developed at the World Bank's
department for impact evaluations (DIME)
and some features are therefore specific to impact evaluation,
but the vast majority of the features are general to any reproducible research.
The practices in these commands are based on experiences in
the 200+ projects within DIME.
Some commands, like iebaltab and ieddtab, simplifies and standardizes analysis
making it less error prone.
Other commands, like ieboilstart and iesave, applies best practices
gathered from across all of DIME's portfolio.
See https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit and
https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices for more details.

### What are keywords?
This is an explanation to the keywords used below. I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.
